Khan Academy Challenges

In this repo, I share my work through the exercises I completed in Khan Academy. The repository includes the solutions for each one of the challenges and my projects for each lesson.

## Lesson 1: SQL Basics

During this lesson, we acquired the skills to generate tables, input data, and execute queries within the SQL framework.

## Lesson 2: More Advanced SQL Queries

Advanced queries, exploring concepts such as AND, OR, IN, GROUP BY, and utilizing the CASE statement to compute results.

## Lesson 3: Relational Queries in SQL

We initiated the utilization of JOIN operations, including LEFT OUTER JOINs, SELF-JOINs for connecting tables to themselves, and the combination of multiple tables for comprehensive data analysis.

## Lesson 4: Modifying Databases with SQL

Lastly, we engaged in practical exercises focusing on the application of UPDATE, DELETE, and ALTER commands within the context of database management.
